/**
 * @file OperationManager.cpp
 *
 * @brief Singleton instance method that registers and executes functions based on operation types.
 *
 * @ingroup Core
 *
 * This class allows high level classes to perform high level operations that are defined by lower level classes.
 * Implementation of chain of responsibility design pattern.
 *
 * The implementation allows for multi-threaded use.
