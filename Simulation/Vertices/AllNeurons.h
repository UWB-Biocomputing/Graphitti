 **
 ** A container of the base class of all neuron data.
 **
 ** The class uses a data-centric structure, which utilizes a structure as the containers of
 ** all neuron.
 **
 ** The container holds neuron parameters of all neurons.
 ** Each kind of neuron parameter is stored in a 1D array, of which length
 ** is number of all neurons. Each array of a neuron parameter is pointed by a
 ** corresponding member variable of the neuron parameter in the class.
 **
 ** This structure was originally designed for the GPU implementation of the
 ** simulator, and this refactored version of the simulator simply uses that design for
 ** all other implementations as well. This is to simplify transitioning from
 ** single-threaded to multi-threaded.

 **
 ** Some models in this simulator is a rewrite of CSIM (2006) and other
 ** work (Stiber and Kawasaki (2007?))
