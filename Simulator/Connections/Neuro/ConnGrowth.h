 * @brief The model of the activity-dependent neurite outgrowth
 *
 * The activity-dependent neurite outgrowth model is a phenomenological model derived by
 * a number of studies that demonstrated a low-level of electric activity (low firing rate)
 * stimulated neurite outgrowth, and high level of electric activity (high firing rate)
 * lead to regression (Ooyen et al. 1995).
 *
 * In this, synaptic strength (connectivity), \f$W\f$, was determined dynamically by a model of neurite
 * (cell input and output region) growth and synapse formation,
 * and a cell's region of connectivity is modeled as a circle with a radius that changes
 * at a rate inversely proportional to a sigmoidal function of cell firing rate:
 * \f[
 *  \frac{d R_{i}}{dt} = \rho G(F_{i})
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  G(F_{i}) = 1 - \frac{2}{1 + exp((\epsilon - F_{i}) / \beta)}
 * \f]
 * where \f$R_{i}\f$ is the radius of connectivity of neuron \f$i\f$, \f$F_{i}\f$ is neuron i's firing rate
 * (normalized to be in the range \f$[0,1]\f$, \f$\rho\f$ is an outgrowth rate constant, \f$\epsilon\f$ is a constant
 * that sets the "null point" for outgrowth (the firing rate in spikes/sec that causes
 * no outgrowth or retration), and \f$\beta\f$ determines the slope of \f$G(\cdot)\f$.
 * One divergence in these simulations from strict modeling of the living preparation
 * was that \f$\rho\f$ was increased to reduce simulated development times from the weeks
 * that the living preparation takes 60,000s (approximately 16 simulated hours).
 * Extensive analysis and simulation were performed to determine the maximum \f$\rho\f$ \f$(\rho=0.0001)\f$
 * that would not interfere with network dynamics (the increased value of \f$\rho\f$ was still
 * orders of magnitude slower than the slowest of the neuron or synapse time constants,
 * which were the order of \f$10^{-2}\f$~\f$10^{-3}sec\f$).
 *
 * Synaptic strengths were computed for all pairs of neurons that had overlapping connectivity
 * regions as the area of their circle's overlap:
 * \f[
 *  r_0^2 = r_1^2 + |AB|^2 - 2 r_1 |AB| cos(\angle CBA)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  cos(\angle CBA) = \frac{r_1^2 + |AB|^2 - r_0^2}{2 r_1 |AB|}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  \angle CBD =  2 \angle CBA
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  cos(\angle CAB) = \frac{r_0^2 + |AB|^2 - r_1^2}{2 r_0 |AB|}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  \angle CAD =  2 \angle CAB
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  w_{01} = \frac{1}{2} \angle CBD r_1^2 - \frac{1}{2} r_1^2 sin(\angle CBD) + \frac{1}{2} \angle CAD r_0^2 - \frac{1}{2} r_0^2 sin(\angle CAD)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  w_{01} = w_{10}
 * \f]
 * where A and B are the locations of neurons A and B, \f$r_0\f$ and 
 * \f$r_1\f$ are the neurite radii of neuron A and B, C and B are locations of intersections 
 * of neurite boundaries of neuron A and B, and \f$w_{01}\f$ and \f$w_{10}\f$ are the areas of 
 * their circle's overlap. 
 *
 * Some models in this simulator is a rewrite of CSIM (2006) and other
 * work (Stiber and Kawasaki (2007?))
 * 
 * NOTE: Currently ConnGrowth doesn't create edges ad the beginning of the simulation.
