 * @brief Implementation of Model for graph-based networks.
 *
 * The network is composed of 3 superimposed 2-d arrays: vertices, edges, and
 * summation points.
 *
 * Edges in the edge map are located at the coordinates of the vertex
 * from which they receive output.  Each edge stores a pointer into a
 * summation point.
