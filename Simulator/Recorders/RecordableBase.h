 * @brief An abstract base class defining the interface for recordable variables in the simulator.
 *
 * The `RecordableBase` class serves as the base class for all variables that need to be recorded
 * during simulation. It defines the interface for accessing information about recorded variables.
 *     -# the basic data type of recorded variables.
 *     -# the data stored in recorded variables.
 *     -# the number of data in the recorded variable.
