 * @ingroup Simulator/Layouts/NG911
 *
 * @brief Specialization of the Layout class for the NG911 network
 *
 * The Layout911 class maintains vertices locations (x, y coordinates), distance
 * of every pair of vertices, a map of the vertices types, and starter vertices
 * map.
 *
 * All the information about the vertices is loaded from a GraphML input file
 * using the GraphManager class. Layout911 registers the vertex properties
 * with the GraphManager, a singleton, which then loads the graph defined in
 * the GraphML input file. Subsequently, Layout911 uses the GraphManager to
 * create a layout of the NG911 nodes used for the simulation.
 * 
 * The GraphManager is only used as a middle-man to facilitate the loading
 * of the initial graph, defined in the GraphML file. After this initialization
 * step, the layout contained within Layout911 is the one used throughout the
 * Simulation.
 * 
 * Currently, we are using 5 vertexTypes in the NG911 models: CALR, PSAP, EMS,
 * FIRE, and LAW. EMS, FIRE, and LAW represent types of Emergency Responders;
 * while CALR and PSAP represent a Caller Region and a Public Safety Answering
 * Point (PSAP), respectively.
 * 
 * Layout911 is in charge of loading and managing the vertices layout while the
 * All911Vertices class holds the internal behaviour of all vertices.
