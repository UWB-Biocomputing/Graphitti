* @brief Encapsulation of vertex event buffering
*
* An EventBuffer is a circular array based implementation of a queue of
* time steps of events produced by a vertex. It provides an interface for the
* Vertex classes, and a vector-like interface for the Recorder classes. the
* former allows event time steps to span epoch boundaries, while the latter
* provides a zero-based indexing of just the events that occurred in the
* precceding epoch.
 *
 * Currently, since there is no exception setup for the simulator, fatal errors are
 * captured using asserts.
*
* See also the eventBuffering.md file in the GitHub pages.
