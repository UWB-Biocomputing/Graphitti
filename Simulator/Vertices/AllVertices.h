/**
 * @file AllVertices.h
 * 
 * @ingroup Simulator/Vertices
 *
 * @brief A container of the base class of all vertex data
 *
 * The class uses a data-centric structure, which utilizes a structure as the containers of
 * all vertices.
 *
 * The container holds vertex parameters of all vertices.
 * Each kind of vertex parameter is stored in a 1D array, of which length
 * is number of all vertices. Each array of a vertex parameter is pointed by a
 * corresponding member variable of the vertex parameter in the class.
 *
 * This structure was originally designed for the GPU implementation of the
 * simulator, and this refactored version of the simulator simply uses that design for
 * all other implementations as well. This is to simplify transitioning from
 * single-threaded to multi-threaded.
