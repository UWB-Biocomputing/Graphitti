 *
 * @brief Specialization of the AllVertices class for the NG911 network
 *
 * The data-centric class uses a container structure for all vertices.
 *
 * The container holds vertex parameters for all vertices.
 * Each kind of vertex parameter is stored in a 1D vector, of which length
 * is number of all vertices.
 * 
 * The NG911 is modeled as a multiple queueing systems. Each vertex contains
 * a queue of events (calls) that are processed in a first-in first-out FIFO
 * fashion, and the processing of the events depends on the type of vertex.
 *
 * Currently, we are modeling 5 vertexTypes: CALR, PSAP, EMS, FIRE, and LAW.
 * EMS, FIRE, and LAW represent types of Emergency Responders; while CALR and
 * PSAP represent a Caller Region and a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP),
 * respectively.
 * 
 * In general, Calls that originate at a Caller Region pass first through a
 * queue at a PSAP where a call taker services the them, and then dispatches
 * an appropriate responder. Once the call is assigned to a dispatcher, it goes
 * through another queue at the Responder vertex waiting for an availale
 * responder unit. The call taker will dispatch a responder unit from the
 * responder closest to the emergency event.
 * 
 * There are a few stochastic processes involved in the NG911 models of which
 * the call arrival rate is one of the most complex. We want to allow the use
 * of different arrival rate models and also be able to recreate pass events
 * from real world 911 data. For this reason, we decided to use an external
 * input file to provide the stream of calls comming into the system. This
 * allows us to support real world data, and also experiment with different call
 * arrival models without modifying the code.
 * 
 * We support the aforementioned input file throught an InputManager object
 * that loads the events from an XML file. The vertices load the call events to
 * be process during an epoch, at the beginning of that epoch. We need to
 * inform the InputManager object of the information associated with each call
 * by registering those properties in the `setupVertices` method. After that,
 * once all the vertices are created the InputManager object also loads the
 * external input file.
 * 
 * We also implement call abandonment, which is when a caller gets tired of
 * waiting in the queue and decides to abandon it. This is supported through the
 * `patience` call property, which represent the amount of time a caller is
 * willing to waiting before abandoing the queue. If their in the queue exceeds
 * this `patience` time, the call is considered abandoned.
 * 
 * Redialing is implemented using a redial probability (`redialP`) in the
 * configuration file. We assume that when a caller decides to redial, he does
 * so immediately and will try until getting through.
 * 
 * The naming of some variables come from either operations research in call
 * centers, or queueing theory. For instance, `trunks` represent phone lines
 * available for incoming calls while `servers` represent the resources that
 * are tied up while processing a call. Servers in a PSAP are call taker, while
 * in a responder node they are responder units. 
 * 
 * Finally, we size the capacity of the waiting queue to the number of trunks
 * and keep track of the number of busy agents at every time step to estimate
 * when the queue is full.
