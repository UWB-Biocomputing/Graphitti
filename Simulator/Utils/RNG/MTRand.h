* @brief Mersenne Twister logic from Nvidia
*
* This file has been modified by the UW Bothell Graphitti group,
* mostly to reorganize it and make it look more like typical C++
* code. This includes splitting it into a .h and .cpp (instead of
* having everything in a .h file), and replacing enums previously
* used to define constants with consts. Given that this was designed
* to produce 32-bit random numbers, and have 32-bit internal state,
* the type uint32_t has been used throughout for precision of
* definition (now that compilers often use 64-bit ints).
*
* Mersenne Twister random number generator -- a C++ class MTRand
* Based on code by Makoto Matsumoto, Takuji Nishimura, and Shawn Cokus
* Richard J. Wagner  v1.0  15 May 2003  rjwagner@writeme.com
*
* The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers.  It
* was designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators.
* The period, 2^19937-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions,
* are far greater.  The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and
* division, and it benefits from caches and pipelines.  For more information
* see the inventors' web page at http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html
