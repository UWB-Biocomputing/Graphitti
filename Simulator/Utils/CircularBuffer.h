 * @brief A basic Template Circular Buffer 
 * 
 * This Circular Buffer is intended for implementing the Event Queuing Model of
 * the NG-911 system. The capacity of the buffer can be defined on instantiation
 * and you are only allowed to resize an empty buffer.
 * 
 * Trying to put an element into a buffer that is full results in an error,
 * captured via an assertion. Similarly, if the buffer is empty the value returned
 * by get() is, naturally, invalid. The onus is on the programmer to check if the
 * buffer is empty or full before retrieving or inserting values.
