/**
 * @file BGTypes.h
 *
 * @brief Used to define uniform data type sizes based for all operating
 * systems. Also used to test the speed of simulation based on the data types.
 *
 * @ingroup Simulator/Utils
 *
 *
 * This type is used to measure the difference between
 * IEEE Standard 754 single and double-precision floating
 * point values.
 *
 * Single-precision (float) calculations are fast, but only
 * 23 bits are available to store the decimal.
 *
 * Double-precision (double) calculations are an order of magnitude
 * slower, but 52 bits are available to store the decimal.
 *
 * We'd like to avoid doubles, if the simulation output doesn't suffer.
 *
 *
 * For floats, uncomment the following two lines and comment DOUBLEPRECISION and
 * the other #define BGFLOAT; vice-versa for doubles.
