 * @ingroup Simulator/Utils
 * 
 * @brief This is a wrapper around the Boost Graph Library (BGL).
 * 
 * It is used to read graphml files that hold the initial simulation graph.
 *
 * The class provides a simple interface to load a graphML file. The BGL needs
 * to know the vertices, edges, graph properties before loading the graph. We
 * tell BGL where to store these properties and their type by registering them
 * before hand using the registerProperty() method.
 * Assumptions:
 *   - VertexProperty is a struct that contains the properties related to vertices
 *     lisgted in the graphml file.
 *   - EdgeProperty is a struct that contains the properties related to edges
 *     listed inthe graphml file.
 *   - GraphProperty is a structure that contains the properties related to the graph.
 *   - All relevant properties are registered via the `registerProperty()` method
 *     before calling `readGraph`.
 *   - Properties not registered are ignored.
 *
 * The structures for the VertexProperty, EdgeProperty, and GraphProperty are declared
 * in Global.h.
 * 
 * The class was made a Singleton because is needed in various places to initialize
 * the differen graph structures of the Simulator.
