 * @brief Abstract base class for Matrices
 *
 * It is the intent of this class to provide an efficient superclass
 * for self-allocating and de-allocating 1D and 2D Vectors and
 * Matrices. Towards that end, subclasses are expected to implement
 * member functions in ways that may require the classes to be friends
 * of each other (to directly access internal data
 * representation). This base class defines the common interface;
 * clients should be able to perform the full range of math operations
 * using only Matrix objects.
