## Overview
This script was created to parse the weight matrix output from neuro simulations and generate a graphml file for input into subsequent simulations.

## `getGraphEdges`
* Must be run with Python3.9
* Takes a weight matrix xml file and existing graphml file as input
* Adds the edge weights to the graphml file
