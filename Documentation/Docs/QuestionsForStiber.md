<h2 id="simulationinfo-to-simulator">SimulationInfo to Simulator</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does all of the stuff in model.h and model.cpp come over to simulator as well? or am i changing it so the params are called directly in the functions instead of siminfo being directly accessed?
<ul>
<li>Seems like the accessors should handle this issue.</li>
<li>also i know model is just manually doing chain of responsibility so not sure i want to get into those weeds yet. maybe tackle this weekend?</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
