/**
 * @file SerializationSecondHalfTest.cpp
 *
 * @brief The serialization test verifies correctness through a series of steps performed across three files:
 *    SerializeFullFileTest.cpp, SerializationFirstHalfTest.cpp, and SerializationSecondHalfTest.cpp.
 *    
 *    STEP 1: Run a full simulation (e.g., 10 epochs) and save its serialized output.
 *    STEP 2: Split the full simulation's input configuration file into two halves based on the epoch count 
 *            (e.g., 10 epochs â†’ 5 + 5 epochs).
 *            Reference file: /configfiles/test-small-long-half.xml
 *    STEP 3: Run the first half of the simulation (e.g., 5 epochs) and save its serialized output.
 *    STEP 4: Run the second half of the simulation (e.g., the remaining 5 epochs) using the serialized output 
 *            from the first half as the starting point.
 *    STEP 5: Compare the serialized output of the second half with the full simulation's serialized output.
 *            If they match, the final result files should also be identical, confirming successful serialization.
 *
 * @note This specific test, SerializationSecondHalfTest, covers the fourth and fifth step above.
 * 
 * To run the serialization tests, execute the script `run_serial_test.sh` located in the `build` directory.
