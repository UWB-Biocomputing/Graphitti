Understanding Serialization and Deserialization 
</strong></summary>

Serialization involves converting an object or data structure into a format that can be stored or transmitted, while deserialization is the reverse processâ€” reconstructing an object from the serialized format.

What is Cereal?
</strong></summary>

Cereal is a lightweight C++11 library designed for object serialization and deserialization. It provides a straightforward interface for serializing objects and supports a wide range of data types. Cereal is efficient and well-suited for handling large data sets, making it a preferred choice for serialization tasks in Graphitti.

<summary><strong>
Why Graphitti Uses Serialization?
</strong></summary>

Graphitti utilizes Cereal to enable efficient serialization and deserialization of the network structure. Serialized data can serve as a checkpoint for large simulations or as input for subsequent simulations with varying conditions. This flexibility enhances Graphitti's efficiency and adaptability in modeling scenarios.

## Basics of Cereal

### C++ Features Supported by Cereal

- **Standard Library Support**: Cereal fully supports the C++11  [standard library](http://en.cppreference.com/w/). You can include the necessary headers from Cereal to enable support for various types (e.g., `<cereal/types/vector.hpp>`). Refer to the [Cereal Doxygen docs](https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/assets/doxygen/group__STLSupport.html) for a complete list of supported types.

- **Smart Pointers**: Cereal supports modern smart pointers (`std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`) via `<cereal/types/memory.hpp>`. However, raw pointers or references are not supported.

- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Cereal can seamlessly handles inheritance and polymorphism- more on this in the coming section.

### Serialization Archive Types

- **Supported Archive Types**: Cereal provides three basic archive types: binary (with a portable version), XML, and JSON. Graphitti primarily utilizes binary and XML archives, managed within the `Serializer.cpp` class.

- **RAII Handling**: Cereal archives are designed to be used in a Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) manner and flush their contents only upon destruction.

- **Serialization Order**: By default, Cereal deserializes data in the order it was serialized.

### Serialization Functions in Cereal

- **Defining Serialization Functions**: Cereal requires to know which data members to serialize in a class. By implementing a serialization function `serialize` within a class, you indicate to Cereal which data members should be serialized. 

- **Default Constructor Requirement**:
    - Cereal requires access to a default constructor for classes it serializes to construct the object during deserialization.

- **Name-Value Pairs**: Cereal supports name-value pairs, allowing you to attach names to serialized objects. This feature is particularly useful for XML archives and is adopted in Graphitti's serialization process.

- **Class Versioning**: While still in work in progress in Graphitti, Cereal supports class versioning, enabling compatibility between different versions of serialized objects.

## Incorporate Cereal in your class 

- Cereal supports two approaches for serialization functions: internal or external. Cereal also provides two types of serialization function `serialize` and `load and save`. For consistency within Graphitti, it's recommended to use an internal single `serialize` function.

- Throughout Graphitti, we typically serialize all data members (private, protected, and public) of a class.

### **Step 01: Include Necessary Cereal Headers**
 Include the necessary Cereal headers for the data member types you want to serialize. If you are using a custom data member type, follow these steps for the custom data type class or struct as well.

### **Step 02: Include and Define the Serialize Function**

Within your class header file
1. Declare the `serialize` function under the public section. 
2. At the end of your header file, define the `serialize` function for your class.

``` cpp

// STEP 01: Add Necessary Header
#include <cereal/vector.hpp>    

class MyCoolClass
{

  public:
    // STEP 02 (a): Declare the serialize function in the public section
    template <class Archive> 
    void serialize( Archive & archive );    

  private:
    std::vector<int> myVector_;
    int X_;
};

//STEP 02 (b): Define the serialize function at the bottom of the header file
template <class Archive> 
void MyCoolClass::serialize(Archive &archive)
{
   archive(cereal::make_nvp("myVector", myVector_), cereal::make_nvp("X", X_));
}


```

Adjust the function names and data member names as per your specific requirements.

### **Step 03: Check for any Special Modifications**

If you answer "yes" to any of the following questions, follow the corresponding steps. Some classes may fall under multiple categories, so review all questions carefully.

<details>
<summary><strong>
Is your class a derived class?
</summary></strong>
Cereal needs a serialization path from the derived class to the base type(s). This is usually handled with either `cereal::base_class` or `cereal::virtual_base_class`. 

#### [a] Is your class derived from a virtual inheritance ?
When inheriting from objects from a virtual inheritance (e.g.`class Derived : virtual Base`), the recommended method is to utilize `cereal::virtual_base_class<BaseT>(this)`  to cast the derived class to the base class. 

```cpp

class MyDerived : virtual MyBase
{
  int y;
  template <class Archive>
  void serialize( Archive & ar );
};

template <class Archive>
  void MyDerived::serialize( Archive & archive )
  { 
    // We pass this cast to the base type for each base type we need to serialize. 
    archive(cereal::virtual_base_class<MyBase>(this), y); 

    // For multiple inheritance, link all the base classes one after the other
    //archive(cereal::virtual_base_class<MyBase1>(this), cereal::virtual_base_class<MyBase2>(this), y);
  }
```
#### [b] Is your class derived from a normal (non-virtual) inheritance ?
When inheriting from objects without using virtual inheritance (e.g.`class Derived : public Base`), the recommended method is to utilize `cereal::base_class<BaseT>(this)` to cast the derived class to the base class. 

```cpp

class MyDerived : public MyBase
{
  int y;
  template <class Archive>
  void serialize( Archive & ar );
};

template <class Archive>
  void MyDerived::serialize( Archive & archive )
  { 
    // We pass this cast to the base type for each base type we need to serialize. 
    archive(cereal::base_class<MyBase>(this), y); 

    // For multiple inheritance, link all the base classes one after the other
    //archive(cereal::base_class<MyBase1>(this), cereal::base_class<MyBase2>(this), y);
  }
```
For more details, refer to the official Cereal documentation on [inheritance](https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/inheritance.html)

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><strong>
Does your class exhibit polymorphic behavior?
</summary></strong>

If you answered "yes" to the previous question about your class being a derived class, this is likely "yes" as well.

If your class exhibits polymorphic behavior, particularly if it's a derived class, follow these steps:

1. Include Necessary Headers:
Make sure to include the polymorphic header to enable support for polymorphism in Cereal.
``` #include <cereal/types/polymorphic.hpp> ```

2. Register Your Derived Types:
Register each derived class using `CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE(DerivedClassName)`.

```cpp
// be sure to include support for polymorphism
#include <cereal/types/polymorphic.hpp> 

class MyDerived : public MyBase
{
  int y;
  template <class Archive>
  void serialize( Archive & ar );
};

//Registering the Derived class
CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE(MyDerived);

template <class Archive>
  void MyDerived::serialize( Archive & archive )
  { 
    archive(cereal::base_class<MyBase>(this), y); 
  }
```

3. Register Your Base Class (if not registered automatically):
Normally, registering base classes is handled automatically if you serialize a derived type with either `cereal::base_class` or `cereal::virtual_base_class`. However, in situations where neither of these is used, explicit registration is required using the `CEREAL_REGISTER_POLYMORPHIC_RELATION` macro.

```cpp
struct MyEmptyBase
{
  virtual void foo() = 0;
};

struct MyDerived: MyEmptyBase
{
  void foo() {}
  double y;
  template <class Archive>
  void serialize( Archive & archive );
};

CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE(MyDerived)

//Registering the Base Class
CEREAL_REGISTER_POLYMORPHIC_RELATION(MyEmptyBase, MyDerived)

template <class Archive>
  void MyDerived::serialize( Archive & archive )
  {
    archive( y );
  }
```

For more detailed information and examples on polymorphism in Cereal, refer to the official documentation on [Polymorphism](https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/polymorphism.html).

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary><strong>
Is your class a template?
</summary></strong>

Follow all the steps from Step 01 as if your class is a regular class. However, if the template involves inheritance, you might need to register all potential instantiations of the template during polymorphism handling.

```cpp

// Include necessary Cereal headers
#include <cereal/types/polymorphic.hpp>
#include <cereal/types/vector.hpp>  

// A pure virtual base class
struct BaseClass
{
    virtual void sayType() = 0;
};

// A templated class derived from BaseClass
template <typename T>
struct DerivedClassTemplate : public BaseClass
{
    T value;
    void sayType();

    template <class Archive>
    void serialize(Archive & archive)
    {
        archive(cereal::virtual_base_class<MyEmptyBase>(this), value);
    }
};

// Register template instantiations
CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE(DerivedClassTemplate<int>);
CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE(DerivedClassTemplate<float>);

// If using Register polymorphic relationships
// CEREAL_REGISTER_POLYMORPHIC_RELATION(BaseClass, DerivedClassTemplate<int>);
// CEREAL_REGISTER_POLYMORPHIC_RELATION(BaseClass, DerivedClassTemplate<float>);

```

<details>
<summary><strong>
Are you serializing smart pointers to objects that do not have a default constructor?
</summary></strong>

Cereal provides a special overload method to handle this situation. Refer to the [Cereal documentation](https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/pointers) for detailed information on this technique.

## Debugging Cereal Errors in Graphitti

Encountering a Cereal error during compiling or running Graphitti? Here's a checklist to troubleshoot:

1. **Include Correct Cereal Headers**: Ensure you've included the necessary Cereal headers for the types you're serializing. If using polymorphic serialization, include `#include <cereal/types/polymorphic.hpp>`.

2. **Default Constructor**: Verify that your class has a default constructor. If not possible, utilize Cereal's special overload methods for handling this scenario.

3. **Polymorphic Type Registration**: If serialization of polymorphic types fails or results in incorrect type information, double-check your type registration. Use `CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE` and `CEREAL_REGISTER_POLYMORPHIC_RELATION` to register polymorphic types correctly.

4. **Runtime Exceptions**: If encountering a runtime exception like 
    ```
    what():  Trying to save an unregistered polymorphic type (AllDSSynapses).
    Make sure your type is registered with CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE and that the archive you are using was included (and registered with CEREAL_REGISTER_ARCHIVE) prior to calling CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE.
    ```
    include the following two archive headers for the respective class:

    ```
    #include <cereal/archives/portable_binary.hpp>
    #include <cereal/archives/xml.hpp> 
    ```
    Reasoning: Polymorphic type registration requires mapping your registered type to archives included prior to CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE being called. Missing archive headers in certain classes could lead to this error.
    
With these checks, you should be able to diagnose and resolve common Cereal errors in Graphitti.
