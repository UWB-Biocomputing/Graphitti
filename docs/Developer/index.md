# Developer Documentation

If you're developing Graphitti code, then here are your reference documents. 

Writing new code? Then make sure to follow our [contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and  *document your code here*. 

Reading code that isn't obvious? When you figure out how it works, then *document it here* and *document it in comments in the code.*

## Student Quick Start

Students, use this [quickstart guide](StudentSetup.md) to help setup, use, and develop with Graphitti.

## Software Development Process

- To further understand our development process, please check out our [gitflow documentation](GitFlowDiagram.md).

- Your pull requests will not be approved if you do not adhere to our [coding conventions](codingConventions.md).

## Graphitti Repository Tools and Workflows
