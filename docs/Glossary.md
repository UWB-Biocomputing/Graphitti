# 5. Glossary

### 5.1 Graph Vocabulary 

> **Source Vertex**- 

> **Destination Vertex**- 

> **Centrality** and **Betweenness** are not basic properties of graphs, they are measures of graphs

> **Centrality**- fraction of all paths

> **Betweenness**- 

> **Bursts**- avalanches that involve all neurons. mega-avalanches. where an avalanche is 1/f or 1/f^2^ behavior, bursts are at 1/f^5^ ish 

### 5.2 Neuroscience Vocabulary 

> **Neurons**: all neurons have energy, typical behavior includes jittering. gaussian energy. every neuron has noise

> **andogenously active cells**- starter neurons, 10% neurons are andogenously active

> **Excititory** - An **excitatory neuron** is defined as a **neuron** that triggers a positive change in the membrane of a post synaptic **neuron** it connects to. An inhibitory **neuron** triggers a negative change in the membrane of a post synaptic **neuron** it conencts to. (Quora)

> **Inhibitory** - Information gathered from:
